Supplementary Material for "Equifinality, sloppiness, and emergent structures of soil biogeochemical models" by Marschmann et al. (2018)

* to reproduce *Fig.1* run PerfectDataSpec.py in Subfolders of Universally_Sloppy. Then call plot_spectra.py

* for *Fig.2* run the following scripts in Monod_Model: monod_model.py, generate_ensemble_predictions.py, generate_geodesics.py. Then plot with plot_timeseries.py, plot_landscape.py, plot_manifold_PCA.py
